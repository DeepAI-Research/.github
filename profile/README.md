# DeepAI Research 

An AI research lab focused on creating simulation software and training pipelines for multimodal generative models. <br/>
Currently focusing on improving spatial understanding and motion in video gen models. 

## Current projects:

### Simverse
Simverse is a synthetic video & image generator with auto-captioning. Simverse allows users to place objects in scenes, add movement, auto-caption, and prompt it to generate videos according to specific requirements. Enables the creation of high-quality training datasets for a wide range of computer vision and NLP tasks.
- Simverse & SimData3D dataset paper + release date late 07/2024


### Distributaur
Distributaur is a simple way to run distributed jobs, leveraging low-cost hardware from Vast.ai's marketplace. Get your synthetic data, rendering or data processing jobs done cheap and at scale. 
Deliver final results to Huggingface with one line of code.
